									<h3>Program Notes</h3>
									<p>I designed this program to explore a rich range of compositional voices that have influenced me through my journey as an
									artist. I hope that you will hear something in the pieces I will present tonight that you have never experienced before,
									and I invite you to contemplate how each composer’s musical language affects you.</p>
									
									<p>To open this program I wanted to explore two very different settings of texts in English. I will begin with three songs
									by the English-born composer and violist Rebecca Clarke. Clarke moved to Connecticut around 1942 to become a governess
									and later married Julliard professor and pianist James Friskin. She spent the rest of her life in America, and completed
									most of her compositional output in this country. Her song style is characterized by exquisite narrative pacing and her
									ability to reproduce the natural patterns and rhythms of the English language. Although she was not herself a pianist,
									her piano writing is also notable for its keen ability to reflect the mood of a poem and communicate the dramatic shifts
									within it.</p>
									
									<p>In these three songs, she looks to great poets from the literary tradition of her birth country, Irish Nobel Prize
									recipient W. B. Yeats and English poet laureate John Masefield, for inspiration. The first song, “The Cloths of Heaven”
									is a setting of Yeats’ poem “Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven” from his third volume of poetry, The Wind Among the
									Reeds. By changing the title, Clarke removes the perceived masculinity of the speaker and allows the universal themes of
									the poem to shine through. The speaker’s desire to give everything to the person they love can be heard in the rising
									and falling lines in both the piano and voice, and their fear of rejection is palpable in her setting of the line “But
									I, being poor, have only my dreams,” and in the music that comes after it.</p>

									<p>Following “The Cloths of Heaven” are two contrasting settings of the Masefield poems “June Twilight” and “The Seal Man.”
									The first is a poem from Masefield’s 1910 collection Poems and Ballads and depicts a perfect summer evening. Clarke’s
									setting captures the feeling of warmth and contentment, and the song hangs like a suspended moment in time until the
									last couplet of the poem where suddenly Clarke captures an outburst of doubt. The second song is an excerpt of text from
									Masefield’s prose poem A Mainsail Haul which presents stories of the people who made their lives from the sea. Clarke’s
									setting of the tale of “The Seal Man” is some of her most effective dramatic writing. The composition builds in freedom
									for both the singer and pianist to make the story their own.</p>

									<p>My second English set will be four John Dowland lute songs performed with guitar. Dowland has been historically linked
									to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, however he was never able to secure a position as court lutenist in her court.
									Instead, he reluctantly went to Denmark to work for King Christian IV of Denmark. While in Denmark, he wrote both his
									second and third songbooks from which tonight’s songs come. Dowland’s lute songs are especially well known for how they
									capture a sense of melancholia in the genre of courtly love songs. His choice of poets also show his continued interest
									in being connected to the artistic output of the English Queen’s court, although he had not been accepted there. It
									seems probable that he continued to campaign for a position at court up until the Queen’s death. In 1612, Dowland
									finally achieved the court lutenist position he had sought with Elizabeth with her successor James I.</p>

									<p>The first song “O sweet woods” on a text by Philip Sidney describes both the pleasure and the pain to be found during a
									solitary walk in the woods. Sidney was a minor player in Elizabeth’s court, but a fervent Protestant and served in the
									military. He is known especially for his sonnets. The second song “It was a time when silly bees could speak” is an
									elaborate play on the meaning and sound of the words “thyme” and “time.” The bee’s inability to access the nectar of the
									thyme echoes the complaints of the poet, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who fell out of Elizabeth’s favor after a
									disastrous military campaign in Ireland. By the time Dowland’s song was published in 1603, Devereux had been hanged for
									treason for an attempted coup. His name was left off of the manuscript. Dowland’s own inability to secure the position
									he wanted may have drawn him to this poem. The last two songs both embody the mystique that surrounded Elizabeth as the
									Virgin Queen. In “Time stands still,” we experience a reverent meditation on that purity by poet Sir Henry Lee who
									served as the Queen’s champion until his retirement in 1590. “Say love if thou didst find”, on an anonymous text, is a
									much more playful veneration on the same topic.</p>

									<p>After the Dowland, I will present excerpts from Hungarian composer György Kurtág’s Kafka-Fragmente. The texts come from
									the letters, notebooks and diaries of visionary author Franz Kafka. Kutág collected these fragments of texts during a
									period of exile in Paris from 1957-58. The Soviet regime in Hungary at the time strictly controlled what types of art
									could be created and performed, and Kurtág in a moment of acute creative and personal crisis, was forced to leave his
									homeland. While in Paris he worked with the art psychotherapist Mariann Stein about whom he later wrote “If my
									experience with her in Paris was marked by rigor on many levels, she later helped me greatly by doing the exact
									opposite: by teaching me to take my time and, as it were, to forgive myself. It made me freer.” Stein’s influence on
									Kurtág was profound and long-lasting. The Kafka-Fragmente, completed in 1987, almost 30 years after his time in Paris,
									are dedicated to Stein. Without her influence I think it is unlikely that Kurtág would have been able to complete this
									work that contains some of his most personal, even autobiographical compositions.</p>

									<p>My initial introduction to this incredible work was through my husband, Spencer Iascone, while we attended the
									University of California, Davis. When we first met, I was programming my Junior recital and he suggested, I think half
									as a joke, that I should program some of the Fragments. I had never heard of them before, but I knew I wanted to impress
									him, so I found a recording. The compressed intensity of emotion present in each short fragment immediately drew me in,
									and I found a violinist daring enough to put together four of them for my recital. This dramatic tour-de-force makes
									equal demands of the singer and the violinist, and I feel so fortunate that Greg Abrell has been willing to come along
									on my second journey with the piece.</p>

									<p>I have chosen to add moments of choreography to demonstrate our interpretation of each fragment. However, I hope that
									each one of you will read the texts and find what emotions resonate with you. The topics range from the subtle humor of
									watching seamstresses caught in the rain, to an absurd metaphor of leopards used to describe hypocrisy in the church;
									from the exhaustion of having a new baby, to the desolate despair of losing your life partner. Each fragment is a
									fascinating microcosm.</p>

									<p>To follow the Kurtág, I have chosen a set by the Argentinian composer Irma Urteaga. Urteaga spent most of her career in
									Argentina where she held positions at Conservatorio Nacional de Música Carlos López Buchardo, Instituto Superior de Arte
									del Teatro Colón and at other institutions within Argentina. Her compositional style can be described as atonal, but
									full of sonorous and rich harmonic colors. For this set, Canticos para soñar, Urteaga selected all female poets, and the
									themes speak to the struggles and joys of being a woman. All four pieces are lullabies of a kind. The first, Canción de
									cuna para mi corazón solitario, is a lullaby for a broken heart. It depicts a woman encouraging herself to find healing
									within herself. In this piece, Urteaga introduces a bell motif that travels throughout the cycle, binding the woman’s
									experiences together. The next song, Canto de nodriza, is an exploration of the mystical connection between a mother and
									her nursing baby. The third song, Vocalise, is a lullaby without words. Through the introduction and resolution of
									dissonance in the piece we experience the presence and release of anxiety. The final song, Capullito, is the most
									thematically traditional lullaby. It ends with the beautiful line, “florece tu vida en la paz del canto.” Urteaga left
									this world less than a month ago on February 14, 2022, and I would like to dedicate this performance to her memory.
									Through her songs we will all continue to “flourish in the peace of singing.”</p>

									<p>My final piece will be the aria ​​”Non, Monsieur mon mari” from Les Mamelles de Tirésias by Francis Poulenc with a
									libretto by the great surrealist Guillaume Apollinaire. The plot of the opera is absurd. Thérèse decides to become a man
									by giving up her breasts, and marches off to war as general Tirésias. Her husband stays at home and vows to find a way
									to have children on his own. He is successful, giving birth to 40,049 children in one day. Tirésias returns and the
									couple reconcile, imploring the audience to have babies instead of going to war. Though the opera is humorous and over
									the top, it reveals a more somber theme. When the opera premiered in 1947, WWI had ravaged France and there was a
									pressing need to repopulate and rediscover a national French identity. I think that the themes of the opera continue to
									speak to all people who wish for a world where we all could take care of our families and flourish.</p>

									<p>Finally, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to my collaborators. Andrew, Grace, Greg, and Xi, I could not
									have done this without your artistic spirit and willingness to explore this repertoire with me. I would also like to
									give a big thank you to Professor Garland, Dr. Reger and Dr. Moteki for all your work with me to prepare this program. I
									would also like to thank Spencer for all your help preparing for the concert, hunting for the right balloons, and
									workshopping my crazier ideas. Thank you all for being here tonight, I am thrilled to have shared this program with you!</p>
